# Conditional Logic Programs

This week's programming assignment includes 4 short programs:

1. Implement a voting test. The user enters their age and then the program prints either, “You must be 18 to vote” or “You are of voting age”.

2. Ask the user to enter a grade percentage.  Convert the grade into a letter grade.  For instance, if the user types 99 then print A+. You can find a sample grading scale here (Links to an external site.).

3. Write a program that asks for two numbers. If the sum of the numbers is greater than 100, print "They add up to a big number" if it is less than/equal to 100 than print "They add up to ____".

4. Implement a random number guessing game. The computer will pick a number at random from 0-9, the user will be asked to guess the number.  Inform the user if they get the answer correct.

You will need to include the following in your program to create a variable "randomNum" and set it to a number from 0-9 at random:

    from random import randint
    randomNum = randint(0,9)

### Comments
This was a assignment I had to create for my CMIT-135 class at Champlain College.
