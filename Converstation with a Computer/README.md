# Conversation with a Computer

Write a program that has a conversation with the user. The program must ask for both strings and numbers as input. The program must ask for at least 4 different inputs from the user. The program must reuse at least 3 inputs in what it displays on the screen. The program must perform some form of arithmetic operation on the numbers the user inputs.

Please include comments in your code to explain how it works

An example program run might look like (have fun with this and be creative): ‘What is your name?’ “Josh” ‘Thanks, Josh. What is your favorite color?’ “green” ‘Mine too. Do you also like Ice Cream?’ “No” ‘Josh, how old are you?’ “40” ‘... and how many siblings do you have?’’ “3” ‘That means you are one of 4 kid(s). Is green the favorite color of anyone else in your house?’

This was a assignment I had to create for my CMIT-135 class at Champlain College. If you check out the code, you may notice the Monty Python references.
