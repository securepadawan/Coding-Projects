# Password Saver

We will be extending the Caesar cypher we looked at earlier into a full-fledged password saver. The program will be able to:

* Lookup passwords for websites
* Add new passwords for websites (encrypting them with the caesar cypher)
* Store these passwords to a file on the computer
* Load passwords from a stored password file

Most of the code is provided but there are some critical components missing. You will need to add these components.

Create a python file called PasswordSaver.py in PyCharm and copy the following code into it.

Add additional menu items to the program. For instance, add the ability to delete passwords.



    import csv
    import sys

    #The password list - We start with it populated for testing purposes
    passwords = [["yahoo","XqffoZeo"],["google","CoIushujSetu"]]


    #The password file name to store the passwords to
    passwordFileName = "samplePasswordFile"

    #The encryption key for the caesar cypher
    encryptionKey=16

    #Caesar Cypher Encryption
    def passwordEncrypt (unencryptedMessage, key):

        #We will start with an empty string as our encryptedMessage
        encryptedMessage = ''

        #For each symbol in the unencryptedMessage we will add an encrypted symbol into the encryptedMessage
        for symbol in unencryptedMessage:
            if symbol.isalpha():
                num = ord(symbol)
                num += key

                if symbol.isupper():
                    if num > ord('Z'):
                        num -= 26
                    elif num < ord('A'):
                        num += 26
                elif symbol.islower():
                    if num > ord('z'):
                        num -= 26
                    elif num < ord('a'):
                        num += 26

                encryptedMessage += chr(num)
            else:
                encryptedMessage += symbol

        return encryptedMessage

    def loadPasswordFile(fileName):

        with open(fileName, newline='') as csvfile:
            passwordreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
            passwordList = list(passwordreader)

        return passwordList

    def savePasswordFile(passwordList, fileName):

        with open(fileName, 'w+', newline='') as csvfile:
            passwordwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
            passwordwriter.writerows(passwordList)



    while True:
        print("What would you like to do:")
        print(" 1. Open password file")
        print(" 2. Lookup a password")
        print(" 3. Add a password")
        print(" 4. Save password file")
        print(" 5. Print the encrypted password list (for testing)")
        print(" 6. Quit program")
        print("Please enter a number (1-4)")
        choice = input()

        if(choice == '1'): #Load the password list from a file
            passwords = loadPasswordFile(passwordFileName)

        if(choice == '2'): #Lookup at password
            print("Which website do you want to lookup the password for?")
            for keyvalue in passwords:
                print(keyvalue[0])
            passwordToLookup = input()

            ####### YOUR CODE HERE ######
            #You will need to find the password that matches the website
            #You will then need to decrypt the password

            #
            #1. Create a loop that goes through each item in the password list
            #  You can consult the reading on lists in Week 5 for ways to loop through a list
            #
            #2. Check if the name is found.  To index a list of lists you use 2 square backet sets
            #   So passwords[0][1] would mean for the first item in the list get it's 2nd item (remember, lists start at 0)
            #   So this would be 'XqffoZeo' in the password list given what is predefined at the top of the page.
            #   If you created a loop using the syntax described in step 1, then i is your 'iterator' in the list so you
            #   will want to use i in your first set of brackets.
            #
            #3. If the name is found then decrypt it.  Decrypting is that exact reverse operation from encrypting.  Take a look at the
            # caesar cypher lecture as a reference.  You do not need to write your own decryption function, you can reuse passwordEncrypt
            #
            #  Write the above one step at a time.  By this I mean, write step 1...  but in your loop print out every item in the list
            #  for testing purposes.  Then write step 2, and print out the password but not decrypted.  Then write step 3.  This way
            #  you can test easily along the way.
            #


            ####### YOUR CODE HERE ######


        if(choice == '3'):
            print("What website is this password for?")
            website = input()
            print("What is the password?")
            unencryptedPassword = input()

            ####### YOUR CODE HERE ######
            #You will need to encrypt the password and store it in the list of passwords

            #The encryption function is already written for you
            #Step 1: You can say encryptedPassword = passwordEncrypt(unencryptedPassword,encryptionKey)]
            #the encryptionKey variable is defined already as 16, don't change this
            #Step 2: create a list of size 2, first item the website name and the second item the password.
            #Step 3: append the list from Step 2 to the password list


            ####### YOUR CODE HERE ######

        if(choice == '4'): #Save the passwords to a file
                savePasswordFile(passwords,passwordFileName)

            for keyvalue in passwords:
                print(', '.join(keyvalue))

        if(choice == '6'):  #quit our program

This was a assignment I had to create for my CMIT-135 class at Champlain College.
